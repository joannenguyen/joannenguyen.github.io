					<p class="question"><strong>DESCRIBE THE COMPANY/SERVICE THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDES:</strong></p>
					<p>One Columbia for Arts &amp; History is a non-profit organization formed to support and promote tourism in Columbia, South Carolina. Our mission is to advise, amplify and advocate for the unified arts and history community. We work to promote collaboration through shared celebrations of Columbia's arts and historic treasures with the goal of raising the quality of life for our citizens, attracting tourist dollars to our city, and further enhancing our vibrant downtown.</p>
					<p class="question"><strong>WHAT ARE THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY GOALS/OBJECTIVES FOR THE APP?</strong></p>
					<p>To supplement and eventually replace their existing printed passports. They want to recreate the passport experience and to augment it with features that only a mobile device can provide. Uses should create a user account with a minimum of information; probably just a user name and password.</p>
					<p>The app should allow participants to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Check into events using their phone as an AR scanner.</li>
						<li>Take notes about events that they attend.</li>
						<li>Show a categorized list of all of the events that they have attended in the past (show all of their digital “stamps”)</li>
						<li>See a list of upcoming events by category and date.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question"><strong>WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THE SITE? WHAT INFORMATION/CONTENT IS THE AUDIENCE LOOKING FOR?</strong></p>
					<p>Any citizens in the greater Columbia area who wish to engage in local arts and who have access to an iPhone.</p>
					<p class="question"><strong>DESCRIBE THE COMPANY’S BRAND, PERSONALITY, AND CULTURE</strong></p>
					<p>One Columbia is a non-profit organization supported by hospitality tax revenues directly allocated by City Council for the purpose of coordinating and communicating the activities and benefits of history, arts and culture for the City.
					Visually, the brand is vibrant, colorful and engaging. The organization represents and features events related to theater, dance, music, visual arts, literature, and historic preservation.</p>
					<p>One Columbia has three missions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>TO ADVISE - One Columbia for Arts and History, in an effort to celebrate, promote and elevate the role of arts and history in our city, serves in an advisory role to City Council. Our goal is to ! unify and focus efforts toward a larger shared purpose and common agenda.</li>
						<li>TO AMPLIFY- One Columbia for Arts and History serves to amplify and enhance the efforts and programs of already established arts/history organizations. By providing a vehicle that encourages organizations to celebrate and promote each other through cooperation and collaboration, we will increase tourism to benefit all.</li>
						<li>TO ADVOCATE - In support of the City's Strategic Plan, One Columbia will work to foster creativity and expand the knowledge of and enthusiasm for history and arts by telling the story of companies, artists and venues and demonstrating the value of the cultural community to the economic interests of the City.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="question"><strong>WHAT ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT PRINTED PASSPORT WORK WELL?</strong></p>
					<p>Participants a engaged and enjoy the act of checking in. They show their passports to friends so that they can compare and contrast the events that they have attend. Event attendance is up and easier to track.
					The passport has really taken off locally. We can’t print them fast enough.!

					<p class="question"><strong>WHAT ASPECTS OF THE CURRENT PRINTED PASSPORT ARE UNSUCCESSFUL?</strong></p>
					<p>The cost of printing and distributing hard materials is prohibitive. Our budget won’t allow us to scale the Passport project. We need a solution that will allow us to reach a far greater population.</p>
